# Dowell Opensource License Compatibility Library

Powered by [Legalzard API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22392526/2s93mBvyQx)

The Legalzard API provides access to a wide range of legal information and resources. It allows developers to retrieve
information about software licenses, legal documents, legal entities, check license compatibility, and more. The API
aims to facilitate the integration of legal information into applications, websites, or other software systems.

## Installation and Usage

Import the package

```python
from legalzard import Legalzard
```

Create an instance of the API. You use this instance to access all the package-API methods

```python
license = Legalzard()
```

## Features

This library offers all the features through the Legalzard API

1. Creating Licenses
   Use the method ```get_all```
   Get all licenses submitted.
   The method returns a response body with two parameters, ```isSucsess```, a boolean showing retrieval status
   and ```data```, a list of licenses.

2. Retrieving all licenses
   Create a license by adding all the fields required by using the ```create``` method which accepts one argument in the
   form of a dictionary. This argument contains all the license information to be created.

3. Retrieving a single license
   Retrieve license information using an ID by using the method ```retrieve``` and passing an Id. The response is
   similar to the ```get_all``` method but the list of of licenses only contains a single license.
4. Updating a license
   Use the ```update``` method. This method updates the license information stored on the database. It accepts two
   arguments, ```id``` and ```license``` object as a dictionary similar to what the ```create``` method accepts.
5. Deleting a license
   Using the ```delete``` method pass an ```id``` and to remove license.
6. Searching for a license
   The API the feature of search for licenses containing a specific phrase. The method accepts a ```search_term```
   argument and returns a response object similar to the ```get_all``` method with list of matching licenses.
7. Retrieving license compatibility.
   Use the ```check_compatibility``` method to check the level of compatibility of two licenses.
   The method accepts a ```comparison_data``` dictionary as
   ```json
    {
    "license_event_id_one": "FB1010000000167238702450728865",
    "license_event_id_two": "FB1010000000167247184554419413",
    "user_id": 609,
    "organization_id": "63cf89a0dcc2a171957b290b"
    }
    ```

8. Check Comparison History
   Get the comparison history by user using the ```get_compatibility_history``` method that accepts two
   arguments, ```organization_id``` and ```user_id```. The response object contains a list of comparison history
   objects.

   ```json
   {
     "isSuccess": true,
     "data": [
       {
         "_id": "645370f22dfb6007eb36da3b",

This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.\nIn 3.0, the international (unported) license suite does not mention sui generis rights. However, ported 3.0 licenses for jurisdictions where those rights exist address them according to CC's 3.0 database rights policy. Under this policy, version 3.0 EU jurisdiction ports must license sui generis rights subject to the terms and conditions of the license just like copyright and neighboring rights, but also must waive license restrictions and conditions (attribution, ShareAlike, etc) for uses triggering database rightsâso that if the use of a database published under a CC license implicated only database rights but not copyright, the CC license requirements and prohibitions would not apply to that use. The license conditions and restrictions, however, continue to apply to all uses triggering copyright. Other ports and the 3.0 international license are silent on sui generis database rights: databases and data are licensed (i.e., subject to restrictions detailed in the license) to the extent copyrightable, and if data in the database or the database itself are not copyrightable the license restrictions do not apply to those parts (though they still apply to the remainder). Thus, regardless of the CC 3.0 license at play (unported, an EU port, another port), uses that implicate only database rights will not trigger the license conditions, while uses that implicate copyright will.\nIn the 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 licenses, attribution may be reasonable to the medium or means, and applied to all elements other than certain notices where the requirement is firm.In the 1.0 and 2.0 licenses, CC licenses contemplated crediting the author only.\nIn 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0, credit must be removed from adaptations and collections, to the extent practicable, at the creatorâs request.\nThis license is based on Austrian law.",

The goal of the GNU GPL was to develop one license that could be used for any project, allowing numerous projects to contribute code.",
               "description": "The GNU General Public License is a series of widely used free software licenses that guarantee end users the four freedoms to run, study, share, and modify the software. The license was the first copyleft for general use and was originally written by the founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Richard Stallman, for the GNU Project. The license grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition.These GPL series are all copyleft licenses, which means that any derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms. It is more restrictive than the Lesser General Public License and even further distinct from the more widely used permissive software licenses BSD, MIT, and Apache.\n\nThe GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community",

               "risk_for_choosing_license": "Under GNU GPL any code which is built upon it also has to be released under one of the GPL licenses. The company building their source on top of it, if they want to release software themselves, must do so using a GPL compatible license. Since itâs mandatory to use the exact copy of the license for the former and the latter codes, you canât mix your proprietary software and GPL-licensed software.",
